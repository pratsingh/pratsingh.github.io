## Exploring Diversity in [The Academy Awards (Oscars)](https://www.oscars.org)

The Oscars are the ultimate recognition of merit in the film industry, and are won by few. These awards are often the crowning achievement for actors, and greatly compliment their career and image. The Academy Awards have been given since the 1920s, making them nearly a 100 years old. <br>
<br>
I decided to analyze the demographics of the Academy Award winners, to deduce how the diversity of winners has evolved in the last 100 years. The notebook and code can be viewed by clicking [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pratsingh/pratsingh.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/Oscars.ipynb). <br>

From the analysis performed in Python, I created and merged a new dataset which I used to create a visualization dashboard in Tableau. It can be viewed below if you have an account, or you can [click here](https://public.tableau.com/views/Trends_vis/Dashboard1?:language=en&:display_count=y&publish=yes&:origin=viz_share_link) to go to Tableau Public. The dashboard showcases the historical trends in diversity representation in the Academy Awards. While more POC are being awarded, the Oscars have remained overwhelmingly white and straight. A few possible explainations exist. Firstly, due to the economic disadvantage that POCs face, arts and acting are less likely to be the primary economic motivators for these groups. Secondly, movie directors and their biases towards white characters impacts the limited number of roles for POC. [UCLA's Hollywood Diversity Reports](https://socialsciences.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/UCLA-Hollywood-Diversity-Report-2019-2-21-2019.pdf) show that while POC make progress, they are *dramatically* underrepresented.
