## Work In Progress 
### Portfolio for the 19-20 school year
This page will serve as a place where I can share my projects / explore technologies in data science. I plan to update it with projects as I continue to learn and implement different techniques through college coursework and personal development. Stay tuned!

## [Monty Hall Problem Simulation](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pratsingh/pratsingh.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/Monty%20Hall%20Problem%20Simulation.ipynb)
Is your chance of winning a prize greater if you decide to switch your answer? In this small simulation, I explored how the probability of winning changes based on the amount of doors and the choice to switch answers.

## Exploring Diversity in The Academy Awards (Oscars)

The Oscars are the ultimate recognition of merit in the film industry, and are won by few. These awards are often the crowning achievement for actors, and greatly compliment their career and image. The Academy Awards have been given since the 1920s, making them nearly a 100 years old. <br>
I decided to analyze the demographics of the Academy Award winners, to deduce how the diversity of winners has evolved in the last 100 years. The notebook and code can be viewed by clicking [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pratsingh/pratsingh.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/Oscars.ipynb).
