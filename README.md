# Portfolio
This portfolio is a compilation of schoolwork and personal projects for the exploration of data analysis, visualization, and machine learning algorithms. I plan to update it with projects as I continue to learn and implement different techniques through college coursework and self study.

## Data Analysis
This example is just a quick test to see if I'm doing this right. This notebook contains a quick fitting analysis. [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pratsingh/pratsingh.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/PratyushSingh_FittingData.ipynb)
