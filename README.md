# Portfolio
This portfolio is a compilation of schoolwork and personal projects for the exploration of data analysis, visualization, and machine learning algorithms. I plan to update it with projects as I continue to learn and implement different techniques through college coursework and self study.

## [Monty Hall Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) Simulation
Is your chance of winning a prize greater if you decide to switch your answer? In this small simulation I explored how the probability of winning changes based on the amount of doors and the choice to switch answers.
