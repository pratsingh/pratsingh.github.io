    "\n",
    "Briefly summarized, this problem stems from the game show *Let's Make a Deal*, the basic premise is as follows:<br> \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, \"Do you want to pick door No. 2?\" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "To model this problem and see the answer we will do the following: <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function that simulates the Monty Hall Problem. Play $N=10000$ games and print the fraction of wins if the player keeps their initial selection vs. if they choose to switch. In addition, we will also model this in a way that allows us to have more than 3 doors.\n",
